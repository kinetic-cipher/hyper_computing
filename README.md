A collection of ideas on novel computation paradigms

This repo documents some original ideas on novel computing paradigms which extend beyond the classical/Turing computing model.
Many of the ideas are inspired by quantum computing and explore the boundary between quantum and classical computing.
The algorithms could find some application in simulating special cases of quantum-like computing or may be useful as solutions
running on actual quantum computers.
